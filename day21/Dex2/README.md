# Dex2 Ethernaut

## Goals

=> This level will ask you to break DexTwo, a subtlely modified Dex contract from the previous level, in a different way.

=> You need to drain all balances of token1 and token2 from the DexTwo contract to succeed in this level.

=> You will still start with 10 tokens of token1 and 10 of token2. The DEX contract still starts with 100 of each token.

### Hints
