# Retirement fund Capture the ether

## Goals

=> I’ve committed 1 ether to the contract below, and I won’t withdraw it until 10 years have passed. If I do withdraw early, 10% of my ether goes to the beneficiary (you!).

I really don’t want you to have 0.1 of my ether, so I’m resolved to leave those funds alone until 10 years from now. Good luck!
